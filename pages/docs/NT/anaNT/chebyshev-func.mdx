# Chebyshev Functions

## Chebyshev's Theta-function

<Scard name="Definition">
If $x>0$ we define Chebyshev's $vartheta$-function by the equation
```math
    \vartheta(x)=\sum_{p \le x} \log p
```
where $p$ runs over all primes $\le$ x
</Scard>

Similary we have another function that is related to the theta function.

## Chebyshev's Psi-function

<Scard name="Definition">
 For $x>0$ we define Chebyshev's $\psi$-function by the formula
 ```math
    \psi(x)=\sum_{n \le x} \Lambda(n)
```
where $\Lambda$ is the [Mangoldt function](/docs/NT/anaNT/mangoldt#definition).
</Scard>

Now with our definitions we can combine these two functions as follows,

since $\Lambda(n) = 0$ unless $n$ is a prime power we can write the definition of $\psi(x)$ as,

```math
    \psi(x) = \sum_{n \le x} \Lambda(n) = \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \sum_{p \le x^{1/m}} \log p
```

Now you might notice that the sum on $m$ is in fact a finite sum. Surely enough, the sum on $p$ is empty if $x^{1/m} < 2$, that is,
if $(1/m) \log x < \log 2$, or if,

```math
    m > \frac{\log x}{\log 2} = \log_{2}(x).
```

Therefore we get,

```math
    \psi(x) = \sum_{m \le \log_2(x)}\sum_{p \le x^{1/m}} \log p
```

Now we can use the theta function to finish it off and get,

```math
    \psi(x) = \sum_{m \le \log_2(x)}\sum_{p \le x^{1/m}} \log p = \sum_{m \le \log_2 x} \vartheta(x^{1/m})
```
